# Open and Run the Daemon-qt.exe wallet for the first time.
# Your firewall and antivirus might pop up to allow connection. Please allow the connections by making appropriate tick marks.
# In the lower left hand corner of the User Interface, you will see “Synchronizing with network” and other sync messages each time you open your Daemon Wallet. 
# If there is a problem synchronizing, it may say “No Block Source Available” instead. 
# If this happens, just close and re-open the wallet until it synchronizes.
# Go to Help -> Debug Console.
# In the Console window enter:

getaccountaddress 0 

# Copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE DEPOSIT ADDRESS, where you will deposit the coins to create a masternode. You should pay 3000 Daemon exactly into this address. No more, no less.
# Now wait for 1 confirmation of the transaction!!!
# In the Console Debug window enter: 

masternode genkey

# Copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE PRIVKEY.
# Open Configuration File in Notepad. This config file is located at C:/Users/<your win username>/Appdata(hidden)/Roaming/Daemon
#It should look like following:

rpcuser=<ANYTHINGHERE>
rpcpassword=<ANYTHINGHERE>
listen=1
allowip=127.0.0.1
port=19371
masternode=1
masternodeaddr=<YourIP>:19371
masternodeprivkey=<PRIVATEKEYREPLACETHIS>

# Now save and close the config file.
# Close the wallet by going to File -> Exit. Open the Daemon Wallet again by running Daemon-qt.exe. This is how you will always start the wallet going forward.
# Wait for 15 confirmations of the transaction of 3000 coins.
# Go to Tools -> Debug Console. Enter masternode start. You will see the response “Masternode started successfully”. 
# Congratulations, your masternode is now running. Now click the Masternodes tab that is now visible. 
# You should see your new masternode appear in the list with the status PRE_ENABLE. This will change to ENABLED after a small amount of time. 
# All masternodes need to be active for a certain amount of blocks before they are recognized by the network and eligible for rewards.
